# CS 245 (Spring 2019) Practice Assignment 08

The delete algorithm received from class wasn't working exactly for me, so I had to do some research and received some help from the CS tutoring center. Other than that, the other functions worked well and I created a BSTNode class to create the node. I also created the compareTo function, which I wasn't sure if I had to do at first but realized that it would be essential in this situation as we would be dealing with comparables.
